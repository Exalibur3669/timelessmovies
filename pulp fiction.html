		<h2>Pulp Fiction</h2>
Pulp fiction has one of the best movie scripts ever written. This movie has achived success through the excellent delivery, phenomenal cast
and inventive shuffling of continuity but the true masterpeice of this film extends from the dialouge, in which, every word has a purpose, every line 
is quotable with not a single moment being used as filler for the 2 hour and 45 minute runtime

	<h2>Critic Reception</h2>
		<li><strong>Lucy Mohl:</strong>There isn't a scene or a character in the film that plays just one way. Bloody bits turn hysterically funny, relief gets riddled with tension, and the lurking question marks are as intriguing as the story resolutions</li>
<li><strong>Rick Groen:</strong>Pulp Fiction is at least three movies rolled into one, and they're all scintillating.</li>
<li><strong>Roger Ebert:</strong> Like "Citizen Kane," Pulp Fiction is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next.</li>
